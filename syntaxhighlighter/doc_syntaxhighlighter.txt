See prismjs.com#supported-languages for the corresponding “[code=]”-tags and the full list of languages which are supported in the full package, you can configure as well.

Example
-------
no syntax highlightning
[code]Just plain text e.g.[/code]

PHP code block
[code=php]<?php echo "This is an php example" ?>[/code]

apache config block
[code=apacheconf]<Location /example>
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from .foo.com
</Location>[/code]

Configuration
-------------
When using a FlatPress Leggero style, the matching prism theme is displayed.
You can configure the prism.js package size to use (tiny, small, full) and the used theme (coy, dark, default, funky, okaidia, solarizedlight, tomorrow, twilight, leggero, leggero-v2, flatmaas-rev).

Just edit for that config.php
